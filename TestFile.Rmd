## Testfile in R Markdown

Let's see how this works. Trying to use R Markdown to produce reproducible research while managing the process with Git(Hub)...

Today's date is: `r Sys.Date()`. (The actual date was included as inline R code!)


## Including Plots

What about the figures directory? It should be created automatically when plots are part of the output...

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

So a plot has been created. Where is the directory?

Somehow it doesn't get created... Well, then I'll make a directory by hand:

```{r directory}
dir.create("test")
```

Removing it again:
```{r rem_dir}
rm("test")
```
